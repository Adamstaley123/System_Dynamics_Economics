# System_Dynamics_Economics
Traditional Economic Models of the business cycle have focused on three key parts, economic recovery/expansion, overheating, and recession. While these provide insight into the economy with traditional patterns, recent economic data over the past few years have left economists with a less clear picture of the health of the economy. Using unsupervised learning machinery, I attempt to more effectively partition economic data more accurately into states, and describe the connections and relationships between these states. Using 9 key economic indicators throughout the economy, we build a markov chain to better understand the probabilities of state transition in the U.S. economy.
