# System_Dynamics_Economics
Traditional Economic Models of the business cycle have focused on three key phases: economic
recovery, overheating, and recession. While these models have provided insight into traditional
economic patterns, recent economic data has left economists with a less clear picture of the
health of the economy. New industries, the global pandemic, and increasing connectedness of
financial institutions across the world seem to be changing the very nature of the Economy.
Using unsupervised learning machinery, I attempt to more effectively and scientifically partition
economic data into states, and describe the connections and relationships between these states.
This unsupervised learning approach allows for objective discovery of economic states without
predefined understanding of the economy, which traditional models often impose. Using 6 key
economic indicators throughout the economy, I use unsupervised clustering to classify economic
states and build a markov probability model to better understand the probabilities of state
transition in the U.S. economy.
